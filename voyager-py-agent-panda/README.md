🐼 Voyager Agent – Panda
Warning: This agent requires custom Python libraries:

ic-py

asyncio

You can install them using pip:

pip install ic-py asyncio


Agent Panda is a Python-based agent for the Voyager system.
It was created as a testing ground and proof of concept for future agent designs, as well as a reference point for developers looking to build their own Voyager agents.

While partially functional, it is primarily maintained as a development example.
In the future, other agents – from the community or the official Voyager OG Dev Team – may replace it.

Until then, Panda will be supported as a reference agent.
